# Explainable Artificial Intelligence Series

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Explainable Artificial Intelligence** article series.

This series explores various aspects of Explainable AI, aiming to make complex AI models more interpretable and transparent. Below are the articles in the series:

### 1. [What is Explainable Artificial Intelligence?](https://blog.abolfazlmohajeri.ir/what-is-explainable-artificial-intelligence)
In this introductory article, we explore the concept of Explainable AI, types and the key techniques used to interpret AI models.

### 2. [Explainable CNN Model on Fashion MNIST Dataset](https://blog.abolfazlmohajeri.ir/explainable-cnn-model-on-fashion-mnist-dataset)
This post introduces an explainable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model developed for the Fashion MNIST dataset, demonstrating how interpretability can be integrated into CNN architectures.

### 3. [Explainable Question Answering System](https://blog.abolfazlmohajeri.ir/explainable-question-answering-system)
In this article, we delve into one of the first efforts to incorporate explainability into a Persian language Question Answering (QA) system, outlining the methodologies and challenges encountered.
